Revision history for Test-Aggregate

0.32_01 03/08/2008
        - Added line directives to aggregated tests to ensure that
          Test::Builder::ok can now report the correct filename and line
          number.
        - set_filenames => 1 is now the default behavior.
        - Split the Test::Builder override into its own package.

0.31    22/07/2008
        - Minor bugfix to play well with Test::Most (reset test failure when
          forcing failure after test program eval).

0.30    17/07/2008
        - Resolved final (known) bug with Test::NoWarnings.  If it's loaded
          before the plan is set, make sure we still adjust the plan.

0.24    15/07/2008
        - Document the 'local $@' problem in "COMMON PITFALLS".
        - Ensure that dump file also forces a failure outside the eval().
        - Make sure that the TEST_AGGREGATE environment variable is set in a
          BEGIN block.  Otherwise, code relying on this variable might get
          called too soon to check it.

0.23    12/06/08
        - Reluctantly added Test::NoWarnings as a dependency to avoid test
          failures.

0.22    11/06/2008
        - If we really do have an error from the eval listed below, make sure
          we have a failing test to accompany it.  Otherwise, tests which die
          might be reported as passing.

0.21    11/06/2008
        - Wrap ->run_the_tests() calls in an eval so that one package failing
          is less likely to stop the other tests from running.

0.20    04/04/2008
        - 'startup' and 'shutdown' are no longer called in BEGIN/END blocks.
          They were getting rather tricky due to timing issues.  This may
          change in the future.
        - Added 'check_plan' attribute.  This allows us to verify the plan of
          those test programs which have one (experimental).
        - Added 'test_nowarnings' attribute.  This can be used to disable
          C<Test::NoWarnings>.
        - Reworked some of the Test::Builder changes to minimize the amount of
          monkey patching and to make the intent clearer.
        - Verbosity is now 0, 1, or 2.  If '1' is verbosity, we only show test
          failures.
        - We now maintain the Build.PL and Makefile.PL files separately due to
          issues with the latter not supporting the features of the former.
        - Eliminated some bogus tests added which were only there to show you
          which aggtest was being run.
        - Fixed the dates in the Changes file.

0.11    15/03/2008
        - Fixed bug where not having Data::Dump::Streamer installed would
          cause test failures if 'dump' was not set.  Reported by numerous
          CPAN smoke testers :)
        - Added optional (and experimental) Perl::Tidy support.
        - Fixed broken 'verbose'.  The 'ok/not ok' message was being output
          regardless of verbose setting.

0.10   13/03/2008
        - Added startup, shutdown, setup, teardown attributes.
        - Add more tests.
        - Clean up dump file generated by tests.

0.08    09/03/2008
        - Require Test::Builder 0.74.
        - We now diag ok/not ok messages for each test program.  This makes it
          much easier to figure out which program failed.
        - Fixed warnings when 'dump' was not set.  Thanks to RENEEB for the
          bug report [http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32443]

0.07    05/03/2008
        - Added TEST_AGGREGATE environment variable.

0.06    15/01/2007
        - Use an END block instead of adding Test::Builder::DESTROY.  This is
          cleaner and doesn't override the DESTROY provided by Test::Most.

0.05    29/12/2007
        - Fixed an open in aggtests/boilerplate.t which made the module fail
          with 5.005.

0.04    29/12/2007
        - Fixed open() to work with versions of Perl < 5.6
        - More extensive overriding of Test::Builder internals.  I tried to
          subclass it but it's not designed to be subclassed and much pain
          ensued.
        - Dump file now has all "run_the_tests" lines at the top and the
          packages below them.  This makes for easier debugging as you can
          comment out test packages one by one simply by commenting out its
          "run_the_tests" line.
        - Fixed bug where runtests() would run tests in a different order from
          the dump file.
        - Fixed bug where Test::NoWarnings would try to run a test after the
          plan was output.

0.03    29/11/2007
        - Moved 'skip_all' files into the t/ directory. Aggregating them
          fails.  mauzo (http://use.perl.org/~mauzo/)

0.02    26/11/2007
        - Fixed bug where multiple tests setting an explicit plan in the use
          statement would cause failures.
        - Attempt to work around 'unauthorized release' issue on the CPAN.
          Simply declaring the 'Test::Builder' package directly is frowned
          upon.
        - Update the docs to warn explain 'shared variable' warnings.

0.01    25/11/2007
        First version.  Run test suites faster.
