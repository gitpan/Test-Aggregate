=head1 NAME

Test::Aggregate::Nested - Aggregate C<*.t> tests to make them run faster.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.362

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Aggregate::Nested;

    my $tests = Test::Aggregate::Nested->new( {
        dirs    => $aggregate_test_dir,
        verbose => 1,
    } );
    $tests->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ALPHA WARNING>:  this is alpha code.  Conceptually it is superior to
C<Test::Aggregate>, but in reality, it might not be.  We'll see.

This module is almost identical to C<Test::Aggregate> and will in the future
be the preferred way of aggregating tests (until someone comes up with
something better :)

C<Test::Aggregate::Nested> requires a 0.8901 or better of C<Test::More>.  This
is because we use its C<subtest> function.  Currently we C<croak> if this
function is not available.

Because the TAP output is nested, you'll find it much easier to see which
tests result in which output.  For example, consider the following snippet of
TAP.  

    1..2
        1..5
        ok 1 - aggtests/check_plan.t ***** 1
        ok 2 - aggtests/check_plan.t ***** 2
        ok 3 # skip checking plan (aggtests/check_plan.t ***** 3)
        ok 4 - env variables should not hang around
        ok 5 - aggtests/check_plan.t ***** 4
    ok 1 - Tests for aggtests/check_plan.t
        1..1
        ok 1 - subs work!
    ok 2 - Tests for aggtests/subs.t

At the end of each nested test is a summary test line explaining which program
we ran tests for.

C<Test::Aggregate::Nested> asserts a plan equal to the number of test files
aggregated, something which C<Test::Aggregate> could not do.  Because of this,
we no longer export C<Test::More> functions.  If you need additional tests
before or after aggregation, you'll need to run the aggregated tests in a
subtest:

 use Test::More tests => 2;
 use Test::Aggregate::Nested;

 subtest 'Nested tests' => sub {
     Test::Aggregate::Nested->new({ dirs => 'aggtests/' })->run;
 };
 ok $some_other_test;

=head1 CAVEATS

C<Test::Aggregate::Nested> is much cleaner than C<Test::Aggregate>, so I don't
support the C<dump> argument.  If this is needed, let me know and I'll see
about fixing this.

The "variable will not stay shared" warnings from C<Test::Aggregate> (see its
CAVEATS section) are no longer applicable.
